## Init Image with Gen2's 18 Seconds

Extending an image with 4 secs at a time... honestly I adore the weirdness. Who is this? What is going on? There are portals in the pictures.  I love it.

Starting again from the Franz Sedlacek bat picture. I edited lightly to speed up the central weird office bit and the ending and reduce file size.

## Init Image Tests with Gen2 and Pika Labs Beta (Updated 31 July 2023)

Init Image from Midjourney:

### Runway Gen2 with no prompt

This has nice motion, but at the end the composition is actually slightly different (more visible in higher res). A prompt will otherwise wipe out the init image with their current settings.

### Pika Labs AI, prompt with variants of "birds flying" as the concept

Getting progressively better with prompt and guidance scale settings. But LOL the duck.

### RunwayML Gen2

Entire composition changes in the end, abruptly.

### Pika Labs

With some fiddling with prompt and guidance, I can get this:

## A Less Realist Image

Another source image by Franz Sedlacek:

### RunwayML Gen2 

Again changes the whole composition at the end, no prompt:

### Pika Labs

Both pleasing! I asked for an ocean of mist.

### Using Pika Labs To Get the Bat to Flap :)

Not perfectly successful... a few attempts -- we would want the guy playing the piano but also the bat:
