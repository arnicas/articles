## Camera Controls on Pika and Runway Gen2 - Zoom In (Sept 13, 2023)

Both RunwayML Gen2 and Pika are now offering camera controls of a sort. You can specify amount of motion too. I still remain fascinated by the random extensions of Gen2.

Pika added a cute little figure walking on this short zoom on an MJ image (quality way reduced since I can't play mp4s here?):

The zoom in with Runway doesn't make little people appear, and distorts the architecture. But it's always interesting to see what happens.

This long 16s one of Gen2 zooming in on a church becomes a lot of weird buildings and a great sky and then wtf knows :)

## Init Image with Gen2's 18 Seconds (Aug 15, 2023)

Extending an image with 4 secs at a time... honestly I adore the weirdness. Who is this? What is going on? There are portals in the pictures.  I love it.

Starting again from the Franz Sedlacek bat picture (see below). I edited lightly to speed up the central weird office bit and the ending and reduce file size.

## Init Image Tests with Gen2 and Pika Labs Beta (Updated 31 July 2023)

Init Image from Midjourney:

### Runway Gen2 with no prompt

This has nice motion, but at the end the composition is actually slightly different (more visible in higher res). A prompt will otherwise wipe out the init image with their current settings.

### Pika Labs AI, prompt with variants of "birds flying" as the concept

Getting progressively better with prompt and guidance scale settings. But LOL the duck.

### RunwayML Gen2

Entire composition changes in the end, abruptly.

### Pika Labs

With some fiddling with prompt and guidance, I can get this:

## A Less Realist Image

Another source image by Franz Sedlacek:

### RunwayML Gen2 

Again changes the whole composition at the end, no prompt:

### Pika Labs

Both pleasing! I asked for an ocean of mist.

## Another Franz Sedlacek, Just Pika

### Using Pika Labs To Get the Bat to Flap :)

Not perfectly successful... a few attempts -- we would want the guy playing the piano but also the bat:
